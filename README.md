# t-SNE-implementation-using-Three.js
A basic implementation of t-SNE using Three.js

This code uses php to get point of any dimension from a csv file following the format specified in the Book1.csv file, converts the points to arrays using JS, and then draws them as objects of choice on a grid using three.js.
