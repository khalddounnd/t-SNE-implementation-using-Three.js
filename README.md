# t-SNE-implementation-using-Three.js
A basic implementation of t-SNE using Three.js

We use php to get points of any dimension from a csv file following the format specified in the Book1.csv file, convert the points to arrays using JS, and then draw them as objects of choice on a grid using three.js.
